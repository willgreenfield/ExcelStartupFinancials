# ExcelStartupFinancials


An excel spreadsheet that takes input prices, expenses, and other consumer data to create a visual financial stream timeline to help determine the profitability of a startup. I created this spread to calculate important financials while building my first startup, VRTX, a small VR-arcade.

Inputs:

Cost Calc:
- Initial start-up cost (fixed)
- "other" costs
- Variable costs (wages, licensing, rent)

Revenue Build:
- Predicted customer flow w/ max capacity & hours open
- Price for product 
- Revenue ramp (uses % customer growth per month before "Steady State" in revenue calculations)

Financial Model:
- Misc. operating costs
- Total tax rate

Outputs:

Financial Model:
- Steady Revenue per month
- Revenue per month
- % revenue growth month-to-month
- Variable cost/month
- Variable cost % margin
- Gross Profit
- Gross profit margin month-to-month
- Operating Profit (EBIT)
- Net income
- Cumulative loss/profit
- profitability & breakeven month
